Credits: The following people have worked on various scripts for this version: Profiler781 and ShmooDude.

Note: Any script in the package classified as a custom alternative script, may behave differently then the default script, this can include extra icons, some abilities only showing on cooldown icons, less options to configure the scripts, etc...  This is because the script is submitted by users and left more or less unedited except any editing needed to make it work with the addon.

7.1.8
	* Updated Frost and Unholy Death Knight, Balance Druid, Beast Mastery, Marksmanship and Survival Hunter, Fire Mage and Affliction Warlock scripts to 7.1.5 Rotations.

	* Added Tracker to more accurately track Scythe of Elune SpellID and charges.

	* Updated script information display to be more concise, and remove unnecessary information, and display credits where necessary.
	* Fixed some API calls that had changed in 7.1.5 dealing with retrieving specialization information.

Credits: The following people have worked on various scripts: HuntsTheWind, Profiler781, Crystal and Vdain, thanks for all your assistance.

Note: The Arms Warrior script was completely written by Profiler781 and functions slightly different then other scripts in my package.  For example several abilities only show on cooldown icons, never on the rotation icons. There is an extra icon for Focused Rage, and there is less options for switching off abilities on the rotation icons and only showing on the cooldown icons, etc...

7.1.7
	* Fix Feral Druid Blood Talons suggestion of renewal which was not suggesting on the rotation icon when checked due to an incorrect variable name.

	* Added new option to Fire Mage to prioritize Phoenix's Flame over Fire Blast when fighting 6 or more enemies.
	* Updated Fire Mage Flamestrike recommendation to require 6 enemies as per guide, was previously 3 enemies.
	* Updated Fire Mage script to no longer recommend Flamestrike during Combustion no matter the settings as it can not generate Heating Up proc and will break the crit chain.
	* Fix Frost Mage Frost Bomb so it only recommends when the target does not already have the debuff.
	* Update Balance Druid script so it recommends Starsurge and Starfall more often as reported by 2briards.
	* Add pooling Astral Power for Balance Druids for Celestial Alignment/Incarnation.
	* Fix Balance Druid Celestial Alignment/Incarnation recommendation.

	* Add Easy Mode talent builds as per guides where available to preset talent builds.
	* Fix Balance Druid Artifact current spell function to report the correct spell.
	* Other minor script fixes and LUA code changes where needed.

Note: Balance Druid script has been flagged as 7.0 even though it is actually based on 7.1.  The reason for this is because at present it produces less DPS then the default Ovale script, and this allows my addon to switch to Ovale if you have the "Switch to Default Ovale script when script is out of date." option checked.

7.1.6
	* Update all scripts for more customizability, the ability to turn off talents from rotation icons, AOE abilities which are situational, and the addition of Defensive and self heal recommendations.

	* Survival Hunter add Murder of Crows to script as its now a recommended ability as reported by Vdain.
	* Survival Hunter Throwing Axes fix as reported by Vdain.
	* Renamed the Druid Multi-Dot option so that it didn't conflict with the Warlock one if using the same Ovale profile for both classes.  This setting will need to be checked and set to how you want it.
	* Renamed Affliction Warlock Multi-Dot option, you will need to make sure the new setting is set how you want.
	* Removed Multi-Dot options from Demonology and Destruction Warlocks as the guide does not suggest multi-dotting.
	* Added all script options accessible from middle clicking the Ovale minimap icon, to also be accessible from my addons options screen.
	* Updated keybinds to better categorize them by specialization not just class.
	* Other minor script fixes and LUA code changes where needed.

	* Other minor script fixes and LUA code changes where needed.

7.1.4
	* Druid scripts and talent presets added for Balance and Feral.
	* Update preset builds feature to accept builds with no talent chosen for a talent row, which means the users own talent choice will be kept.
	* Update the preset builds so situational CC or Defensive Talents are not chosen, unless the guide specifically says to choose a particular talent.  This is so the preset builds will keep the users chosen talent.
	* Added configuration item to Show/Hide minimap icon in the options screen for the addon.

	* Modify ScriptInfo to store guide information for display more efficiently.
	* Other minor script fixes and LUA code changes where needed.

7.1.3
	* Added minimap icon and tooltip, which can also function as an LDB display in ElvUI etc...
	* Added Talent Build Swapping feature, and preset talent builds.
	* Update scripts to allow for all talents chosen in the available preset builds.

	* Fixed Obliterate not recommending when Runes available, as reported by lunshea.

	* Fixed definitions for Dire Beast, Dire Frenzy and Beast Cleave Buffs which were defined wrong.
	* Add allowances for Grimoire of Sacrifice for Destruction Warlocks, as per request of SplusR68.
	* Fix Havoc so that it no longer constently recommends when a target already has the havoc debuff, as reported by SplusR68.
	* Other minor code fixups, as necessary.

Note: The new builds feature is still a work in progress and I hope to have it completed for the next version, I was not willing to delay bug fixes any longer waiting for it to be finished.
